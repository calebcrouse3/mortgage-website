It captures the profit from income (or loss if income doesnt cover all expenses),

This is calculated as the after tax/fee sale income from the home (which depends on how much equity 
you have in the home) minus the out of pocket cash initially invested including the downpayment. Some might refer to the
total return as the total profit, but generally the term profit should only be
used when referring to the rental income that a property generates. The total return 
includes this profit and the money from the sale of the home."""

This encompasses the total net value of assets (cash and property) you have.
Its basically the same at total return ecxept it uses the equity in the home instead of profit from selling the home.
Meaning the down payment is still part of you networth, unlike your total return,
and you didnt have to pay fees to sell the home."""

The IRR is the annualized yearly return on investment for the time period up to a particular year 
discounted by the time value of money. One way to interpret the IRR is that you would make as much money
on this investment as you would if you had invested the out of pocket cash in a different investment
with this growth rate. This isnt quite right because its the hurdle discount rate which 
factors in risk as well as returns. Explore more.
