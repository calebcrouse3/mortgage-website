# Prompt

This project is a mortgage payment analysis tool. Its build with python and streamlit. The webpage has a side bar with various input and the main page has charts that display details about mortgage payments, timelines of home values, etc. The main page has a link bar that switched between different visualizations. Some visualizations have additional inputs. 

I want to convert this whole project to a react website. It does not need a backend. There is no user logons. Its just the interactive webapp with visualizations. Start by doing a detailed analysis of the project and put all your documentation in the readme. Make it very detailed and helpful for completing the task of converting this project to react. After doing you analysis of the project and its functionality, write out the steps to convert this project to a react webapp. I want to keep the project as simple as possible to start and build in complexity from there. I have very limited experience with web development.
